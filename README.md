# Tile_Math_Game__Software_Engineering
The independent project portion of my Software Engineering class.

## How to play!!
There is a 3x3 grid of numbers. The goal of the game is to eliminate all the tiles except the middle one. By selecting each tile, a number of arrows may appear that allows you to move one tile into another one by performing some math operation. Try to figure out how it works!

If you're pressed for time, here's what each arrow does:
||Moving right adds the numbers
Moving left subtracts the selected tile from the left tile, only works if result is positive
Moving down divides bottom tile by selected tile, only works if result is whole number
Moving up multiplies the two numbers||

Good luck!
